(base) maxime@latitude:~/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/memote$ memote
Usage: memote [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Metabolic model testing command line tool.

  In its basic invocation memote runs a test suite on a metabolic model.
  Through various subcommands it can further generate three types of pretty
  HTML reports (snapshot, diff and history), generate a model repository
  structure for starting a new project, and recreate the test result history.

Options:
  -h, --help           Show this message and exit.
  -V, --version        Show the version and exit.
  -v, --verbosity LVL  Either CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG
                       [default: INFO]

Commands:
  history  Re-compute test results for the git branch history.
  new      Create a suitable model repository structure from a template.
  online   Upload the repository to GitHub and enable testing on Travis CI.
  report   Generate one of three different types of reports.
  run      Run the test suite on a single model and collect results.

Usage: memote report [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Generate one of three different types of reports.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  diff      Take a snapshot of all the supplied models and generate a...
  history   Generate a report over a model's git commit history.
  snapshot  Take a snapshot of a model's state and generate a report.
